MozCamp Delhi January 2013 Web Fundamentals [Intermediate] Demos.

To Do:
1. Make the code readable and introduce indenting.
      The code in demos folder contains code in a single line (Done so as to include the code dynamically into the page which is not needed now).
2. Make the demos load on the fly i.e. from their original source (in demos folder) and not from the index file.
